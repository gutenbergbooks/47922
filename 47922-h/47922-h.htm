<h3 class="no-break"><b>THE CATHEDRALS OF ENGLAND</b></h3>







<p class="p2">Such a general survey of the most
representative English cathedrals as
is undertaken in the present article
naturally leaves no space for a detailed
consideration of the
various diversities of
architecture that
they present, and
future issues of this
series will be devoted
to illustrating, individually,
the various
developments of the
English Gothic style.
The characteristic
features of the English
Gothic cathedrals,
as compared
with those of the Continent,
and particularly
with those in
France, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The English minsters
are long, narrow
and low in contrast
with the greater
squareness and height
of French contemporary
churches. The
English transepts
have bolder projections, and the number of
side chapels is smaller. The east end is
almost invariably square. The aisles are
practically always single; Chichester is the
only example to the contrary. The central
tower is a predominant feature; and a
single western tower is characteristic of
English early churches. Flying buttresses,
though not uncommon, are not so prominent
as in French cathedrals. Doorways
are more simple,
placed in less important
positions, and
often provided with
a separate elaborate
porch, as at Salisbury.
Window traceries,
though developing
along the same lines
as in France, finally
evolve "Perpendicular"
instead of
"Flamboyant" tracery.
The beautiful
fan-tracery vaulting
is an important feature
of English
Gothic, and is peculiar
to it. The clustered
shaft is a special feature
of the style.
Great emphasis was
placed by the English
architects on the
development of
mouldings; and the
generally smaller
scale of English work lead to greater refinement
and attention to detail in carving.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking difference between
the English and the Continental
cathedral, is however, in its situation. Instead
of being almost invariably pressed
upon and crowded by the streets and shops
of the city, the English minster is usually
set about with great masses of foliage, and
wide stretches of lawn.</p>

<p>Litchfield Cathedral is sometimes styled
the "Queen of English minsters," and,
though surpassed by other cathedrals in
age, size, grandeur of site and elaborate
decoration, it has yet claim to the title because
of the symmetry, proportion and
picturesqueness of its general effect. It is
built of red sandstone, and dates mainly
from the thirteenth to the fourteenth centuries.
The earliest structure on the present
site was a Norman church dating from
about 1100. The oldest part of the existing
building is the lower part of the west
half of the choir, erected about 1200. The
transepts followed in 1220-40; the nave
dates from 1250, and the west front from
about 1280, while the Lady-Chapel belongs
to the beginning of the fourteenth century.
The cathedral close was formerly
surrounded by a wall and moat; and in 1643
the cathedral was defended against the
Puritans, who battered down the central
tower and demolished many of the carvings,
monuments and windows. It was,
however, restored before the end of the
century. The most conspicuous external
features are the three beautiful spires and
the fine west façade. This façade is one
of the most graceful and harmonious in
England; and it has the advantage over
such a front as that of Peterborough in its
organic connection with the rest of the
building. It is covered with niches for
about one hundred statues, almost all of
which are now filled with modern carvings.</p>

<p>Chichester Cathedral was originally begun
about 1085, completed in 1108 and
burned down in 1114. In its present form
it is substantially a Transitional Norman
building of the twelfth century, with some
pointed details introduced after a second
fire in 1186. The Lady-Chapel dates from
1288-1304. The spire, erected in the fifteenth
century, collapsed in 1861, and has
since been rebuilt. The whole edifice has
been restored since 1848. The detached
Bell Tower, a feature peculiar to Chichester
among English cathedrals, is, despite its
weather-worn appearance, one of the most
recent parts of the building, dating from
the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Canterbury Cathedral, the third church
erected on the same site, represents English
architectural history from 1070 to 1495;
but its general external appearance is that
of a magnificent building in the Perpendicular
style. The present structure was
begun by Laufranc, the first Norman architect,
and was finished in 1130. The choir
of this Norman cathedral was burned in
1174, and the present choir, in the Transitional
style from Norman to Early English,
was erected by William of Sens (who
may almost be said to have introduced the
Pointed style into England), and by his
successor, William the Englishman (1174-1180).
The old Norman nave and transepts
remained intact for two hundred years
more, when in 1378-1410 they were replaced
by the present Perpendicular structure.
The great central tower was added in 1495.
The northwest tower is modern, the older
tower having been pulled down, with
doubtful wisdom, to make room for one to
match its southwest neighbor. In spite
of its huge proportions the interior of the
nave produces a wonderful effect of lightness.
The choir, one hundred and twenty
feet long, is the longest in England. The
great Norman arches, supported by circular
and octagonal piers alternately, furnish a
striking contrast to the inner portions of
the nave.</p>

<p>Norwich Cathedral was begun in 1096,
and has preserved its original Norman plan
more closely than any other in England.
The first Bishop of Norwich, Herbert de
Losinga, completed the choir and transepts,
and began the nave. The latter was finished
by his successor about 1140. The
clearstory of the choir was rebuilt in 1356-69,
and the vaulting of the nave and choir
were added in the fifteenth century. In
the same century the west front was
altered, and the spire rebuilt. The most
prominent features of the exterior are the
lofty spire and the unusual apsidal termination
of the choir.</p>

<p>Durham Cathedral, locally known as
"the Abbey," is usually ranked among the
six finest English cathedrals, though, apart
from its magnificent situation, the first
impression made by the exterior scarcely
seems to warrant so high a place. The
composition of the east end is externally
unsatisfactory; and the west front suffers
from the difficulty of obtaining a good
near view.</p>

<p>The site was first built upon by the
monks of Lindisfarne, who, in 999, chose it
as a resting place for St. Cuthbert's remains.
After the Norman conquest a new
and larger church was begun, the choir of
which seems to have been completed in
1093-95. The transepts and nave, also in
the Norman style, were all finished by
1143. The cloisters and upper part of the
central tower are Perpendicular (1400-80).
A destructive restoration was carried out
in 1778-1800, sweeping away many ancient
details, and spoiling the exterior by scraping.
Recently the entire building has been
restored.</p>

<p>Hereford Cathedral was begun in 1079,
and not finished till 1530, and consequently
shows an interesting mixture of architectural
styles. The nave, south transept and
piers of the tower are Norman, the Lady-Chapel
is Early English; the north transept
was rebuilt between 1250 and 1288; the
north porch was erected about 1290. The
tower dates from the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Peterborough Cathedral is one of the
most important Norman churches left in
England, though at first glance the exterior
does not seem to bear out this
assertion. The elaborate and somewhat
foreign-looking west façade, with its recessed
arches, gables and sculptures, is
however an Early English addition of
about 1220; and forms, as it were, a screen
in front of the original west wall. The
present building is the third church on
this site. The first was destroyed by the
Danes; the second was burned in 1116.
The oldest part now standing is the choir,
consecrated about 1140. The great transept
dates from 1155-77, the late-Norman
nave from 1177-93, and the west transepts,
in the Transitional style, from 1193-1200.
A series of uniform Decorated windows
was added throughout the church in the
fourteenth century. The spires and pinnacles
of the flanking turrets of the west
façade are of the Decorated and Perpendicular
periods. The interior gives an impression
of unusual lightness for Norman
architecture, an effect enhanced by the color
of the stone. In 1643 it suffered severely at
the hands of the iconoclastic Puritans.
The clearstory and triforium of the nave
are impressive in size and effect. The
painted wooden ceiling dates from the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>Salisbury Cathedral is a splendid example
of pure Early English, having had the rare
advantage of having been begun and finished
within a period of forty years, 1220-1260,
and is remarkable for the uniformity
and harmony of its construction. Mr.
Ferguson has pointed out that there is
scarcely a trace of foreign influence in
the building, the square east end taking
the place of the apse of the Norman
churches, and fixing the future character
of English choirs; and he adds that it is
"one of the best proportioned and at the
same time most poetic designs of the middle
ages." The various parts of the building
all unite to lead the eye to the central
point,&mdash;the richly adorned spire built in
1250, which is the loftiest in England.
The sculptures on the beautiful west front
were nearly all destroyed by the Puritans,
but have recently been replaced.</p>

<p>Worcester Cathedral is in plan a double
cross with very short transepts, and with a
chapter-house and spacious cloisters on the
south side. In general characteristics it is
Early English, but includes specimens of
all styles from the Norman down to the
latest Perpendicular. The oldest parts of
the present church are the choir and Lady-Chapel,
which date from the first quarter
of the thirteenth century. The north side
of the nave belongs to the Decorated and
the south side to the early Perpendicular
period; but they are very similar in general
appearance. The central tower shows
traces of the transition from Decorated to
Perpendicular. In the interior, the choir
dates from the purest Early English period,
and impresses by its richness and uniformity;
and the magnificent groined roof,
extending in an unbroken line for 420 feet,
is a feature that perhaps no other cathedral
can match.</p>

<p>Lincoln Cathedral, splendidly crowning
the hill on which the city is built, may
perhaps claim to be the finest church in
Great Britain. Other cathedrals equal or
surpass it in certain points; but in the
combination of size, delicacy of detail,
effectiveness of both interior and exterior,
good preservation and grandeur of position,
it has probably no rival. Of the original
cathedral, built at the end of the
eleventh century, the tower, a portion of
the west front, and part of first bay of the
nave remain. The Norman cathedral was
injured by an earthquake in 1185, and its
restoration was at once undertaken by
Bishop Hugh, called "St. Hugh of Lincoln"
(1186-1200), who finished the choir
and east transepts&mdash;the earliest piece of
Early English work of known date. The
west transepts and chapter-house were
completed soon after, and the nave, including
the west front, by about 1250.
The upper story of the central tower,
which dates from about 1240-50, was added
between 1300 and 1320. The upper parts
of the west towers are late Decorated,
dating from about 1380. Among the more
noteworthy external features are the fine
central and west towers, and the west
façade, in spite of its mixture of styles and
the fact that it is in some degree merely
a screen. The choir of the interior is the
oldest known example of the Early English
style, and is separated from the nave by a
decorated screen (1320) surmounted by the
organ. Though the vaulting is too low
the entire interior is harmonious and
imposing.</p>

<p>Winchester Cathedral is a stately edifice,
incorporating every style of English architecture
from the Norman to the Perpendicular.
It was founded on a more ancient
site in 1079. The choir and transepts were
finished in 1093. The conversion of the
nave from Norman to Perpendicular was
begun by Bishop Edington before 1366,
and the whole was completed in 1486. The
builder of the greater part of the nave was
Bishop William of Wickham, the renowned
architect and statesman, who occupied the
See from 1366 to 1404. The church is the
longest in England, measuring 560 feet in
all. The west façade, with its spacious
portal, was begun in 1350, finished in the
fifteenth century, and restored in 1860.</p>

<p>Ely Cathedral is architecturally one of
the most interesting in England. It occupies
the site of an abbey founded by St.
Ethelreda in 673. The existing building
was begun in 1083 by the first Norman
abbot, and the last half at least was completed
in its original form when the see of
Ely was created in 1109. The west part of
the nave, including the west tower, was
finished about 1180, and the west porch
was added before 1215. The east end was
added between 1229 and 1254. The central
tower, which belonged to the original
church, fell in 1322, and advantage was
taken of this opportunity to construct the
beautiful decorated octagon. A new spire
was erected on the west tower at the end of
the fourteenth century, the weight of which
may have caused the collapse of the northwest
transept, though some authorities
think the latter was never finished. The
whole building has been carefully restored.
The most striking feature of the edifice is
the castellated west tower, which is unlike
any other cathedral tower in England, and
to some extent suggests military rather
than ecclesiastical architecture. The
greater part of this tower is Transitional
Norman (117-489), but the octagonal top
and turrets were added in the decorated
period.</p>

<p>Wells Cathedral is, in its present condition,
predominantly an Early English
building, of the first half of the thirteenth
century. It is the third church on the
same site, and the foundation of the present
edifice is commonly attributed to Bishop
Joceline, 1206-1242. The church as he
designed it was finished at the end of the
thirteenth century. Thereafter a complete
transformation of the east part was
undertaken, the first step being the construction
of the Lady-Chapel, about 1320,
while the Presbytery dates from about
1350. The upper parts of the central tower
also belong to the early fourteenth century.
The upper parts of the west towers
and cloisters are Perpendicular. The
beautiful west façade, elaborately adorned
with arcading and sculptures, is, like the
west front of Lincoln, architecturally a
mere mask. The choir, one of the most
beautiful in England, is Early or Geometrical
Decorated in the general effect.</p>

<p>York Cathedral is one of the largest and
grandest of English minsters. The present
structure is the third on the site, and
was built by the first Norman bishop. The
choir was rebuilt by Archbishop Roger,
1154-81, the south transept by Archbishop
Gray in 1215-55, and the north transept
about the same time, while the Norman
nave was gradually replaced by the present
one between 1290 and 1345. The Lady-Chapel
was added in 1360-73, and the
present choir substituted for Archbishop
Roger's before 1400. The towers date from
the fifteenth century, and the edifice as
thus rebuilt was reconsecrated in 1472. In
its present form, therefore, the minster
shows examples of the Early English Decorated,
and early and late Perpendicular
styles. The most striking features of the
exterior are the noble west façade in the
Decorated and the imposing central tower
in the Perpendicular style.</p>

<p>Gloucester Cathedral stands on a site
consecrated to religious purposes since the
seventh century. The church was raised
to cathedral dignity in 1541, having previously
been included in the diocese of
Worcester. In its present form the body
of the church is the work of Abbot Serlo
at the end of the eleventh century; but
this Norman core was most skilfully altered
and recased, chiefly in the fourteenth
century, and in general external appearance
is thoroughly Perpendicular.</p>

<p>St. Albans Abbey, which was raised to
the dignity of a cathedral in 1877, is one of
the finest and largest churches in England.
The earliest parts of the existing building
date from the eleventh century; the choir
was built in the thirteenth, and the Lady-Chapel
in the fourteenth. The fine tower
is Norman. An extensive, and not especially
successful, restoration of the buildings
including a new Early English west front
with a large decorated window, has recently
been completed.</p>

<p>Exeter Cathedral, though comparatively
small and unimposing, is, in virtue of its
details, one of the most admirable examples
in England of the Geometrical Decorated
style. The oldest existing parts of
the building are the transeptal towers, dating
from the early part of the twelfth century,
almost unique features in English
churches. The rest of the cathedral was
built, or, at any rate, altered from Norman
to Decorated, between 1280 and 1370, mainly
from designs of Bishop Quivil. The elaborate
west façade was added by Bishop
Brantyngham (1370-1394). The whole has
been carefully restored.</p>
